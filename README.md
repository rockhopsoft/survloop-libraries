SurvLoop is a Laravel-based engine for websites dominated by the collection and publication of open data. 
This is a database design and survey generation system, though it will increasingly be a flexible tool to solve many 
web-based problems.

This package is a container for copies of third-party code which is otherwise challenging to easily install and
integrate with each SurvLoop installation. It is required and included by the 
<a href="https://github.com/wikiworldorder/survloop">master SurvLoop package</a>.
